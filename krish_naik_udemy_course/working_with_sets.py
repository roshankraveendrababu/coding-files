# we can initialize a set with {}
# unordered and does not contain duplicate
# we can also use set() to create a set in which we pass a list or a tuple and typecast it
# add() - adds elements onto the set
# remove() -  removes a particular element from the set
# discard() - removes that particular element if present or else it does not give error like remove() .
# pop() - removes the first element and prints it (FIFO)
# clear() - empties the set altogether
# in - checks whether an value is present in the set in O(1) TC
# set1.union(set2) -  returns all the unique values that are present in both the set
#  there is an similar function for intersection
# intersection_update - it does not require a new set to store the resulting values . it just stores them in set1
# difference - syntax is the same as the above returns all the values of set1 that are not present in set2
# there is an similar _update function for this as well
# symmetric difference - returns the unique elements from both the set -  intersection of the sets
# issubset() - returns a boolean value on whether set1 is a subset of set2
# issuperset() -  returns a boolean value on whether set1 is a superset of set2
# len - same as list or tuples
